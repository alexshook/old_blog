Somehow I completely messed up this Octopress— installed a new theme, lost half of the source files (but not master?), and moved all the old posts from 2013 to a random folder. I even don’t know how that happened, but it happened.

When I started this blog, it was the beginning of my first Ruby class and I clearly did not know what I was doing. A year and a half later, I hope I'm a bit wiser.

And that I can keep my posts together.

I thought now would probably be a good time to finally settle on a theme and get a fresh start.

Hello.
