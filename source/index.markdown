Hello! I'm Alex. I'm a software developer working in New York City.

I've been writing code ever since I turned eleven and an owl didn't deliver my Hogwarts letter. I may not have gotten a toad and a phoenix feather wand, but creating for the web is definitely magical. Still planning on visiting the wizarding world at Universal Studios, though.

Before I made web applications, I spent some time in public relations. Most of my work was on the digital side (online marketing, eCommerce, etc.), but I've also planned some great events and directed a photoshoot or two.

Things I do in my spare time include photography, writing about code, and yoga.
