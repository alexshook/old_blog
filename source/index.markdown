Hello! I'm Alex. I'm a software developer working in New York City.

I've been writing code ever since I turned eleven and an owl didn't deliver my Hogwarts letter. I may not have gotten a toad and a phoenix feather wand, but creating for the web is definitely magical. Still planning a trip to the wizarding world at Universal Studios, though.
