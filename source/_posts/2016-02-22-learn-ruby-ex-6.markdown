Totally not getting through [Learn Ruby the Hard Way](http://learnrubythehardway.org/book/) with any kind of efficiency. I've thought about skipping up to exercise 45 a million times, but that would be cheating.

``` ruby
puts "ex 6"

types_of_people = 10
x = "There are #{types_of_people} types of people."
binary = "binary"
do_not = "don't"
y = "Those who know #{binary} and those who #{do_not}"

puts x
puts y

puts "I said: #{x}."
puts "I also said: '#{y}'."

hilarious = false
joke_evaluation = "Isn't that joke so funny? #{hilarious}"

puts joke_evaluation

w = "This is the left side of..."

e = "a string with a right side."

puts w + e
```
