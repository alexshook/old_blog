Lately I've found myself needing to do quite a bit of CoffeeScript. For some reason, whenever I work in CoffeeScript it's much more difficult for me to keep track of what’s a jQuery object and what’s a native DOM object.

I have a strong preference for vanilla JavaScript, but I need the jQuery API and am always trying to call it on native DOM objects. I'm constantly swapping objects with things like `$list = $(list)`, too.

Guess I need to work on that.
